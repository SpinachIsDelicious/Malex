# MalexCopy

This is a copy of The PC Security Channel's malware testing solution Malex.

Malex is considered malicious by 6 solutions. If you are asking this, it is because Malex is a malware executor. These are false positives, and it is supposed to be ran on a virtual machine anyway.

Malex is not an open source solution because of skids and stealers of code. I get irritated at them, and of course this is supposed to be ran on a virtual machine anyway.

### Features
- Memory checking
- User friendly
- Debug (if there is an error, it will tell you)
- Stable version checking (uses requests module of Python)
- Prediction of the time all files will be executed
- Gets total time for all files to finish running
- Virtual memory overload protection: if the RAM on your system is overloaded it will not run the file and instead wait one second until the RAM drops. (You must have good ram on the VM)

### To-do
- Use the requests module on Malex to grab my discord information and display it updated (really easy, but i'm lazy)
- Stop use of Malex on computers you are not authorized to run it on
- Create guide on how to prevent use of Malex on computers (for schools, etc)
- IP banning banned devices (school ips)
- Automatically updating Malex?

### Contact
[Email](mailto:spinachofficial@protonmail.com) Slow at getting in contact, effective
[Discord](https://discord.com/users/871531078391853158) Add me on Discord for now, I will create a support server later
More contact methods may be added.

### Support
Need support? Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one. Go to the Issues section and include a question or bug. I will respond shortly.

### Oooo what is developer key?!?!?!
The developer key allows me to access beta features. It may be given to beta testers. It requests a website, retrieves Python code, then evaluates it using the built in ```eval(code)```

## Some info
Malex requests a Pastebin in order to make sure the version of Malex is fully updated and prevents use of older versions of Malex (I don't want you to use older versions)
[The pastebin requested by Malex](https://pastebin.com/raw/Rsr7KGZ0) <br>
Don't believe me? Like, why would I care?
### How does the Pastebin work
The version is stored by the Malex code. Malex compares the Pastebin raw data to the version stored and if the version is outdated, it will not let you operate Malex.

### Can I develop alongside you?
No
