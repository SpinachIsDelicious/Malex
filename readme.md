Malex is considered malicious by 6 solutions. If you are asking this, it is because Malex is a malware executor. These are false positives, and it is supposed to be ran on a virtual machine anyway.

Malex is not an open source solution because of skids and stealers of code. I get irritated at them, and of course this is supposed to be ran on a virtual machine anyway.

### Features
- Memory checking
- User friendly
- Debug (if there is an error, it will tell you)
- Stable version checking (uses requests module of Python)
- Prediction of the time all files will be executed
- Gets total time for all files to finish running
- Virtual memory overload protection: if the RAM on your system is overloaded it will not run the file and instead wait one second until the RAM drops. (You must have good ram on the VM)

### To-do
- Use the requests module on Malex to grab my discord information and display it updated (really easy, but i'm lazy)
- Stop use of Malex on computers you are not authorized to run it on
- Create guide on how to prevent use of Malex on computers (for schools, etc)
- IP banning banned devices (school ips)
